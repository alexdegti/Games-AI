# Finite State Machine Demo
A demo depicting the usage of state machines for game agents. The output is presented on a console.
There are three characters in the game: an elf, a dwarf and a centaur. They explore a dungeon,
and might come across monsters or treasure chests. There are other scenarios and adequate states
to facilitate them. When the game is over (after a set amount of update calls), the character with
most gold coins collected wins. (unless, they are in a terminal state which essentially equals death)

This demo is based upon the book "Programming Game AI by Example" (specifically the second chapter), written by Mat Buckland.
